- Fixed Mac and Linux copy to clipboard handling.
- Forcing encoding to be UTF-8 on Mac and Linux to temporarily fix
  encoding errors when freezing the binary.
- Data files now load from the same directory as the running script
  rather than the current working directory.

  doesn't know the possible primitives.
